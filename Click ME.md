# About Me ~
Hey there! I'm Raghav, a Class 10 student with a passion for hacking (the ethical kind, of course!). mostly I'm not busy cracking codes or solving puzzles, you can find me indulging in my love for memes and all things funny.

## Hobbies
- **Hacking:** I love exploring the world of cybersecurity 
- **Coding:** i'm still learning_lol
- **Gaming:** When I'm not hacking, I'm usually gaming. I'm a pro at [mostly all] and always up for a multiplayer showdown :].
- **Memes:** I have an endless collection of memes and can find the perfect one for any situation. Need a laugh? I've got you covered!

## Fun Facts
- I once hacked my school's Wi-Fi network just to change the name to "NO wifi today."
- My dream is to become a pro hacker.
